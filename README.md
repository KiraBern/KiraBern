I am interested in 3D modeling (for Blender) and programming in languages that are as close as possible to machine languages or in those thanks to which you can hack other programs or intercept their traffic. 

You can see my first works in 3D here [Tap]( https://github.com/KiraBern/KiraBern/tree/main/my%20job%20for%203D )
I know that there were many mistakes in my work, but after creating each new work, I make fewer mistakes in the hope of achieving a higher level of modeling. 

I know AVR Assembler very well from programming languages, and now I am learning Java. A few months ago I came up with the idea to slightly modify the amateur program  [PathOfBuilding](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding/releases) for one game, it allows you to check the character leveling branch before spending resources on it in the game. At first glance, pumping there is really scary ... [just look at this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiraBern/KiraBern/main/picture/PoE-SkillTree-33.webp)
    The idea is to use the capabilities and the database of this program by connecting AI to them, which ultimately will allow you to get ready-made pumping branches for the given desired end results.
but i can't do it yet due to poor knowledge of java on which i want to implement it. (Assembler is too confusing in terms of outputting information, and writing simple code will take a long time, unlike java)
